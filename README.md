## Description

This Repo is an MVP, demonstrating a fully functional mock-up of a Social Media Back-end. This back-end is built using ExpressJS and MongooseDB/MongoDB, and includes a whole host of routes for interacting with the Database externally. In addition, the repo also contains the necessary schemas for building and populating the relevant database. 

## Installation Instructions

Thanks to Node Package Manager, everything required to install and run the application is contained internally. Simply open the terminal and run the command "npm install".

## Usage Information

To use the application, the user must first seed the database using the command "npm run seed". Then, spin-up the locally hosted instance by running the "server.js" file in the main branch using the included command "npm run start". Finally, send requests to the port indicated by readout in the terminal (3030 by default).
